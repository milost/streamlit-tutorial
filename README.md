# Streamlit Tutorial

I have only texted this on my Mac. It should also run on any Linux distribution in the same way.
Unfortunately I have no clue how to work under Windows with Python (setup etc.) but I guess you
can google on how it install it an set it up.

The following steps should work in most cases, but if you have problems installing Streamlit, please have a look at the official [Streamlit installation guide](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/installation.html).

## Requirements

1. Python version greater or equal to v3.6

## Setup

1. Open a console/terminal
2. Make sure you have installed a python version >3.6 by executing: `python --version`
3. Clone the repositoy by executing: `git clone https://github.com/milost/streamlit-tutorial.git`
4. [**OPTIONAL**]: If you want to [setup a specific virtual environment and activate it][https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/26/python-virtual-env/]
5. Install tutorial dependencies by executing `pip install -r requirements.txt`
